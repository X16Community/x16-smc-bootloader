#   a bootloader was present. From bootloader v3 the magic value and version
#   number has been moved to the end of flash memory (0x1ffe-0x1fff).
#   The start of the bootloader is expected to be a table of rjmp instructions.
#   There is one rjmp instruction with a target address within the bootloader area
#   where the low byte is 0x8a. This rjmp instruction should consequently be avoided.
#   This script exits with an error code to remind us about the above.
